How to get your pull request accepted
-------------------------------------

We want your submission. But we also want to provide a stable experience for our users and the community.
Follow these rules and you should succeed without a problem!

Run the tests!
--------------

Before you submit a pull request, please run the entire django-moderation test suite via::

    python setup.py test


If you add code/views you need to add tests!
--------------------------------------------

We've learned the hard way that code without tests is undependable. If your pull request reduces our test coverage because it lacks tests then it will be **rejected**.

For now, we use the Django Test framework (based on unittest).


Keep your pull requests limited to a single issue
-------------------------------------------------

django-moderation pull requests should be as small/atomic as possible. Large, wide-sweeping changes in a pull request will be **rejected**, with comments to isolate the specific code in your pull request


Code style
----------

Please follow PEP8 rules for code style.
